This repo contains various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Fold cross validation, Decision Tree, SVM, K-Means Clustering, Principal component analysis, and a CNN based image classification model.

A decision tree is a branching method to illustrate every possible outcome of a decision. It can also be used to assign monetary/time or other values to possible outcomes so that decisions can be automated. Decision trees are commonly used in machine learning for operations research, specifically in decision analysis, to help identify a strategy most likely to reach a goal.This model uses breast canacer dataset, and tries to check how accurate is the diagonisis given in the dataset.
